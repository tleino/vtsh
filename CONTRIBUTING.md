## Wishes

* Test on different Unix-like systems and make pull request for portability
  fixes
* Package for different Unix-like systems (and tell about it e.g. using e-mail)

But you can make a pull request of anything you see useful and we can have
a chat about it.

## Style

* Follow OpenBSD style(9) a.k.a. KNF which is very close to Linux-kernel style and similar to K&R
